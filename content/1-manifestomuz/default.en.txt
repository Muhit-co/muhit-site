Title: Our Manifesto

----

Text: 

## 1. We should all be able to share our ideas and visions for our neighbourhoods and build a community of shared trust.

By creating a platform for people to share their ideas about their neighbourhoods, districts and cities, Muhit aims to foster active citizenship at the local level. 
<br /><br />

## 2. We should build a long-lasting relationship with our community and our local representatives.

Muhit builds a social network between community members, NGOs and local representatives and allows local governments to have a more informed dialogue with their constituents. 

<br /><br />

## 3. We should be able to access information about our local neighbourhood and form public opinion from the grassroots. 

Muhit helps citizens have more access to goings-on about town, and in turn aims to build a sense of ownership and facilitate collaborative city-making.
